# Marvin.JsonPatch.Signed
Sometimes life isn't fair and you are stuck supporting the world as it existed 10+ years ago. So if you'd like to use [Marvin.JsonPatch](https://github.com/KevinDockx/JsonPatch), but for whatever reason are still using strong naming, I've signed and repackaged them for you.

Enjoy!

## Caveats
* These are not built from source, they simply sign the existing assemblies on NuGet and publish them back to NuGet.
* Yes, the private key is checked-in :smiling_imp:
